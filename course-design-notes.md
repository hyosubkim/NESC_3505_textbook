### How to Teach the Course
General structure: 
- For 3 credit hr course, split into one 90-minute lecture and one 90-minute tutorial/lab per week
- Weekly structure with regard to student responsibilites:
    - Pre-lecture reading
    - Problem set (~10 total)
    - Completed tutorials from previous session
    - Brief summary of what they learned and at least one question about the module or how it relates to the rest of the course?
- Lecture day structure:
    - Short mini-lectures to address the questions raised by students in their pre-class work
    - Students spend the majority of lecture time working in small groups to solve problems on a worksheet package (tutorial notebook)
    - Interleave with a few 5-10 minute mini-lectures and/or wrap-up discussion that focuses on key problems from the worksheets (notebooks)
    - Completed worksheet packages (tutorial notebooks) are collected in the following lecture, graded for completion, and returned electronically.
- Lab day structure:
    - Students work in small groups on weekly homework assignments with TA support
    - Students complete weekly peer review assignments that require them to solve a problem, assess three of their peersâ€™ solutions, and complete a self-assessment of their own solution
