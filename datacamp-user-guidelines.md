## DataCamp 
In this course, you will have the option to leverage the significant resources that [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com), a massive open online course (MOOC) platform for data science education, can provide. We recommend using your @student.ubc.ca email address for DataCamp registration to avoid additional enrollment verification. However, before opting in to using DataCamp, please review DataCamp's Privacy Policy below: 

*At any time you can cancel your subscription and delete your data permanently in your [account settings](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/account_settings). We would be sad to see you leave though :-( You may not be able to delete all of the data which we process about you via your [account settings](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/account_settings). In that case, we advise you to contact us via our [privacy contact form](https://support.datacamp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360004155713#skip_wizard).*

For those students who opt-in to use DataCamp, the teaching team will add all students registered in this class to the class DataCamp "group", using the email address you provide to us. You will receive an invitation email from DataCamp with a link that will allow you to set a password. Once you have logged in for the first time, you will get to your assignments by clicking on "Learn" in the upper left menu, and then "Assignments" in the left-hand menu that follows. 

Each DataCamp assignment has a due date, which conveys when you need to have covered that material in order to keep up with the work in KIN 482. Each one has an estimated duration that you'll see when you start it, and these seem fairly accurate. DataCamp will remember your progress, so you don't have to complete an assignment all in one sitting. You can work in smaller or larger chunks at your preference, log off, and log back on to resume the course later. Note that with DataCamp you have as many opportunities as you need to provide the correct solution. This part of your grade is essentially making sure you are practicing the skills you need to succeed in the course and write functional code.

You are not required to opt-in to using DataCamp. You will be assigned an alternative assignment or set of assignments, should you choose to opt out.
