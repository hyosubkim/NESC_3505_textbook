Here's an example with the size of the planet and its corresponding biodiversity. In this example, `pop` is short for the population of all living creatures found on the planet (our imaginary space travelers have very advanced measurement devices for counting such things!). Let's define an \"interest\" index for planets whereby a planet is considered \"Very interesting\" if it is large (size > 10,000) and biodiverse (pop > 10 m); \"interesting\" if it is large *or* biodiverse (but not both); 'or \"not interesting\" if it is neither large nor biodiverse (for some reason, our explorers are biased towards big planets populated by many living creatures). \n"
