# Syllabus 

## Basic Course Information
KIN 482E Advanced Seminar in Neuromechanics ("Data Science for Kinesiology"); 2023 Winter Term I; 3 credit hours 

## Time and Place
Mon and Wed, 9:30 - 11:00 am, UBC Life Building (Room 2214)

## Description
Learn how to write code and use data science tools for analyzing data. 

**Long version:** This course provides hands-on experience with learning to program in Python. Students will learn how to think algorithmically in order to process, visualize, and analyze data related to all types of research questions. Through a combination of tutorials, problem sets, and a final project, students will learn some of the most important tools and techniques in the Python data science ecosystem. This course will be especially useful for undergraduate students interested in getting actively involved in research at UBC. In addition, this course provides a strong background for future advanced undergraduate and graduate work in computational approaches to kinesiology, including modeling. However, even for students who do not plan to do scientific research in the future, this course will still provide a solid foundation in core computing and data science skills that will serve them well whether going into industry, healthcare, or another technical field.

## Textbook
We will be using an open-source textbook available for free on the Web:

## Hardware & Software
Students are required to bring a laptop, chromebook or tablet to both lectures and tutorials. Students who do not own a laptop, chromebook, or tablet may be able to [loan a laptop from the UBC library](https://services.library.ubc.ca/computers-technology/technology-borrowing/).

All other required software will be provided by the instructors. Students will learn to perform their analysis using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). Worksheets and tutorial problem sets as well as the final project analysis, development, and reports will be done using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) accessed via [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca).

## Prerequisites
Two of the following courses: 
- KIN 310
- KIN 311
- KIN 313
- KIN 316
- KIN 411
- KIN 419

***No prior programming experience is expected or required.***

## Learning Outcomes
The course is designed to achieve the following primary goals:

- Write code in a high-level programming language (i.e., Python).
- Process, visualize, and analyze data using some of the most powerful (and popular) tools in data science (e.g., pandas, NumPy, Jupyter).
- Approach and solve novel problems in a logical, step-wise (algorithmic) manner.
- Effectively visualize and present the results of your data analyses.
- Leave the class well-prepared to advance your programming and data analysis skills, whether in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses (e.g., statistics, modeling, machine learning, etc.), academic research, or industry.

## Schedule


## Policies

### Late Registration

Students who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.

### Late Assignments / Quiz Absence

Students **must be present** at the invigilation venue (in class, on Zoom, examination centre, etc) to take quizzes; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the quiz and will be assigned a grade of zero.

Students who will miss a quiz **must provide a self-declaration of academic concession prior to the quiz** (see Canvas homepage for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the quiz will result in a grade of zero.

There will be **no extensions for the lecture and tutorial worksheets**; late assignments will receive a grade of zero. Instead, we will drop the lowest grade on tutorials and worksheets for the semester.

For all other assignments and the course project, a **late submission will receive a 50% penalty**.

### Autograder Policy

Many of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that students work on. No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. The autograder will automatically stop (time out) for each student assignment after a maximum of 5 minutes; **any ungraded questions at that point will receive a score of 0.**

Students are responsible for making sure their assignments are *reproducible*, and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. In particular, **please ensure that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct filename to the correct folder.** A common mistake is to manually download data when working on the assignment, making the autograder unable to find the data and often resulting in an assignment grade of 0.

In short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes (assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that will be assigned.

### Re-grading

Students get a free 1% at the end of the course. If you want questions regraded, you can fill out a form at the end of the term documenting in detail what you want regraded. Regrading is only offered if the teaching team makes a mistake. If the total sum of value of possible points via regrading is greater than 1%, you can submit (please do so before the last day of class); otherwise the regrade request is rejected. Note: If you submit a regrade request, you may get less than 1% via regrade.

Note if you received 0 on an assignment when you shouldn't have, please contact the course coordinator as soon as possible rather than waiting until the end of the term.

### Device/Browser

Students are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended; Safari has had issues with Canvas quizzes in the past.

### Missed Final Exam

Students who miss the final quiz must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.

### Academic Concession Policy

Please see [UBC's concession policy](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0) for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework, quizzes, and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.

See our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.

### Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University's policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at <http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0>.

### Plagiarism

Students must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:

-   the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)
-   the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another
-   the generation of code by automatic code-generation software

An "adequate acknowledgement" requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.

The above attribution policy applies only to assignments. **No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during a quiz or exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related question.**

**Repeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course.**

## Links to Other Courses
Completion of this course will help prepare you for the following courses:
- Introduction to Computational Modeling 
- KIN 419: Laboratory Investigations in Neuromechanical Kinesiology

 

## Communication
We will use (Canvas, Microsoft Teams, Edstem...?) to facilitate discussion outside of class. 

## Course Structure
Classes will utilize a mixed format of lectures, videos, class discussions, labs, and student presentations in order to foster an interactive and engaged learning experience. A link to the current schedule can be found here (create link) and will be updated as we go. 

Need to really think about this. Some ideas and things to consider:
- 3 credit hour course
- Meet 2 days/week for 1.5 hrs per session?
- Split meetings into 1 lecture, 1 tutorial/lab per week 
- Notes on UBC's CS 0.5 ([Dawson et al 2018](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~meghana/sigcse_2018_dawson.pdf)):
    - For 4 credit hr course, split into one 80-minute lecture and one 50-minute tutorial per week
    - "In each content module students are assigned pre-class work consisting of reading custom course materials, solving problems using the new concepts, and writing and submitting a brief summary of what they learned and at least one question about the module or how it relates to the rest of the course."
    - "In lecture we use Just-In-Time teaching [15] and deliver short mini-lectures to address the questions raised by students in their pre-class work. Students spend the majority of lecture time working in small groups to solve problems on a worksheet package; we usually interject with one or two 5-10 minute mini-lectures and/or wrap-up discussion that focuses on key problems from the worksheets. Completed worksheet packages are collected in the following lecture, graded for completion, and returned electronically."
    - "In tutorials, students work in small groups on weekly homework assignments with TA support. They also complete weekly peer review assignments that require them to solve a problem, assess three of their peers’ solutions, and complete a self-assessment of their own solution."


## Learning Objectives

The course is designed to achieve three primary goals:

1. You will learn to write programs in a high-level programming language (i.e., Python).
2. You will learn to process, visualize, and analyze data using some of the most powerful (and popular) tools in data science (e.g., pandas, NumPy, Jupyter).
3. You will learn to approach and solve novel problems in a logical, step-wise (algorithmic) manner.
4. You will learn to effectively visualize and present the results of your data analyses.
5. You will leave the class well-prepared to advance your programming and data analysis skills, whether in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses (e.g., statistics, modeling, machine learning, etc.), academic research, or industry. 

Major course themes:

- Core programming skills
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data analysis

Here are specific topics related to Python and scientific computing we will cover in this course: 

- Why programming/Python/data science?
- What is a computer program?
- Variables and assignment
- Data types and conversion
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Conditional statements and control flow
- For loops
- Functions
- File I/O (input & output)
- Scientific computing using NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Structuring data with Pandas

We will actively apply the core programming skills you learn throughout the course to explore and better understand research-related questions and examples (**[Note: some of these are pie-in-the-sky ideas that will likely not make the cut.]**):
- Work with Romeo and Jean (and others) on good 'example use' cases and datasets (interleave with concepts from Romeo's lab/methods course KIN 419)
- EMG: reflex responses
- Postural responses
- From JS: introduce derivates and integrals for discretized values
    - Students experiment with position, velocity, acceleration traces (JS)
- Some linear algebra?
    - Change between coordinate systems within a sports science context (JS)

- Exploratory data analysis
- Working with repeated measures data
- Data processing and dealing with outliers
- Statistical inference using Python 
  - Bayes' Theorem
  - Regression (introduce vector and matrix notation here?)
- Working with behavioral data
  - Kinematics (e.g., reach trajectories)
  - Reaction times
  - Signal Detection Theory
  - Psychophysical functions
  - Sensorimotor adaptation
- Signal processing
  - Time vs frequency domain representations
  - Sampling
  - Filtering (consider using Paul Gribble's iPhone and heartrate exercise)


## Computing Environment
The course will rely on a online computing environment called Jupyter. Each student will have their own JupyterHub instance and can connect to this from a variety of devices over the internet. The address of the class JupyterHub is here (create link). You will log in with your normal UBC credentials.

## Learning Assessment
Much of the work you do for the course will, for good reason, require lots of programming. We will mostly be using Jupyter notebooks for assignments and labs that you will turn in for grading. [Using Jupyter tools to assess student learning](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/getting-going.html). 

The grade in the course will be determined by the following categories:

### Class Participation (xx% of grade)??
Attendance and participation is critical for success in this course as it takes a hands-on, practical approach to programming and data analysis. 

### Labs (xx% of grade)
The main part of the course will consist of several labs. These labs will explore key concepts in kinesiological research, with a focus on the brain-behavior relationship, and will consist of multiple exercises.  Most of this work will take place in the Jupyterhub.

### Homework (xx% of grade)
Programming is a skill, and, like any skill, requires consistent practice. As such, you will receive regular programming assignments meant to solidify the conceptual knowledge gained through readings, videos, and lectures. 

Thoughts:
- Skills-based notebooks or DataCamp exercises (must be prior to each session - unlimited opportunities to get right)
- More involved problem set each week/module (see Gribble course, NYU course)

### Final Project (xx% of grade)

## University Policies

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.  

Details of the policies and how to access support are available on [the UBC Senate website](https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success/).
