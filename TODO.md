## Steps to completing development of course

1) **Tech stack:**
    - UBC's [JupyterHub Instructor Guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/jupyterhub-instructor-guide/): seems pretty straight forward; question of whether to use free Jupyter Open or pay for Jupyter Course (~$20/student), which allows for course integration with Canvas   
&nbsp;   

3) **Define how skills and knowledge will be regularly assessed.**
    - **(Almost complete)** Weekly problem sets, likely in form of Jupyter notebooks (for ideas, look at Gribble course, NYU course, NDS course, CPSC 103)
    - **(Almost complete)** Practice problems and exercises
        - To be worked on during weekly recitations/tutorials
    - DataCamp exercises:
        - Can likely follow the [schedule used in Aaron Newman's course](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/NESC_3505/schedule.html)
        - See [here](https://www.datacamp.com/universities#classroom-form) for more detailed information - DataCamp Classrooms is free and provides full access for teachers and students
        - Will need to apply in July (takes up to two weeks for apps to get approved)
&nbsp;

4) **Fill in course structure details based on above two points.**


Probably no longer relevant, as there will not be a final project. 

2) **Define final project.** What is the scope? Find datasets. Look at CPSC 103 and UCSD course for examples.
    - Final assignment in form of Jupyter notebook and presentation
    - Introduce data and motivating question
    - Read in some data
    - Data wrangling
    - Data visualization
    - Data analysis
    - Tell story of analysis
