      Hints:

  *

    You can use a |1000x1000| 2D matrix to represent the grid of lights

  *

    Here is some python code you can use to load in the input file, and
    for each line, split the instructions into a list of items:

    | <#cb1-1>with open("A6_input.txt") as fp:
     <#cb1-2>  for line in fp:
     <#cb1-3>      e = line.strip().split(" ")
     <#cb1-4>      print(e)|

    You will need some |if| statements to determine which instruction it is, and how to act on
    them.

  *

    Remember to add 1 to the second |x|-coordinate and the second |y|-coordinate, to handle how Python indexes into arrays. For example, |Z[0:5]| results in the first, second, third, and fourth values of the array |Z|. To get the first 5 values you would have to use |Z[0:6]|.
