    Advent of Code 2015 Day 2

Complete both Part 1 and Part 2 of Advent of Code 2015 Day 2
<https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2>.

Please make sure to save your puzzle input as a file called |A4_input.txt|

Your code should assume that the input is in a file named |A4_input.txt|

This will allow us to run your code locally to veryify that it works.

*Hint*: In Part 1 and in Part 2 you will need to find the smallest of
three quantities. You can use the built-in function |min()| to do this:

| <#cb1-1># in Part 1:
 <#cb1-2>slack = min(l*w,l*h,w*h)
 <#cb1-3>
 <#cb1-4># in Part 2:
 <#cb1-5>ribbon = 2*min(l+w,l+h,w+h)|

*Hint*: To load in the input file line by line there are many ways to do
it, but here is one way:

| <#cb2-1>with open("A4_input.txt") as fp:
 <#cb2-2>    for line in fp:
 <#cb2-3>        l,w,h = map(int,line.split('x'))|

Here is another way that will use the NumPy function |genfromtxt()| to load in the entire file into one big 2D array:

| <#cb3-1>import numpy as np
 <#cb3-2>a4 = np.genfromtxt('A4_input.txt', delimiter='x')|

There are other ways to read in the file as well. Whatever works for you
is fine.
