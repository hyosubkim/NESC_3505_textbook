    NumPy Exercises

Complete the following 5 questions.

Please note that you are not required to complete each question using a
single Python command. You may use multiple lines of code. Also please
note that there is not one single correct way of completing each
question. There are many ways you might code up the solution to each.

 1.

    Create a |5x5| 2D array with
    Ï€

    on the border and |0| inside:

    | <#cb1-1>[[3.14159265 3.14159265 3.14159265 3.14159265 3.14159265]
     <#cb1-2> [3.14159265 0.         0.         0.         3.14159265]
     <#cb1-3> [3.14159265 0.         0.         0.         3.14159265]
     <#cb1-4> [3.14159265 0.         0.         0.         3.14159265]
     <#cb1-5> [3.14159265 3.14159265 3.14159265 3.14159265 3.14159265]]|

 2.

    Consider the |1x10| 1D array |Z|:

    | <#cb2-1>Z = np.array([3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3])|

    Compute the sum of squared elements of |Z|

 3.

    Create a |10x5| 2D array containing random integers between 10 and 20, inclusive.

 4.

    Consider the |1x100| 1D array of integers |Z|:

    | <#cb3-1>Z = np.random.randint(0,10,100)|

    Print out the unique elements of |Z|, sorted in descending order (largest first, smallest last)

 5.

    Construct a |1x50| array |Z| containing the sequence |5,4,3,2,1| repeated 10 times:

    | <#cb4-1>[5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4
     <#cb4-2> 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1]|
