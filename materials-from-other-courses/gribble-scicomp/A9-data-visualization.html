    Graphics

| <#cb1-1>import numpy as np
 <#cb1-2>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt|

 1.

    Define a 1D array |x| containing 10 values starting at 0, ending at 0.9, in increments
    of 0.1. Define a vector |y| that is equal to
    sin⁡(2∗π∗x)

    . Generate a line plot with |x| on the horizontal axis and |y| on the vertical axis. Use blue circles at each data point
    (markersize of 8.0), connected by blue solid lines, with a linewidth
    of 2.0. Label the horizontal axis “X” and the vertical axis “Y”. Set
    the range on the horizontal axis so it goes from 0 to 0.9 in steps
    of 0.1, and on the vertical axis so it goes from -1 to 1 in steps of
    0.2.

 2.

    Define a 1D array |x| |[1,2,3,4,5]|. Define a 1D array |y1| |[1,2,3,4,4]|, |y2| |[1,5,6,8,10]|, and |y3| |[5,4,2,1,1]|. Generate a multi-line plot using squares (markersize 6.0)
    connected with solid lines (linewidth 1.0). Label the axes as shown,
    and set axis limits and axis ticks as shown. Add a legend as shown. The |y1| colour is blue, the |y2| colour is red, and the |y3| colour is magenta.

 3.

    Define a 100-length 1D array |x| starting at 1 and ending at 100 in increments of 1. Define |y| equal to |(x * 0.15) + N| where N is a 100 element 1D array of random values chosen from a
    gaussian distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 0.5. Let |z| be equal to |((x * 0.05) + 2) + N2| where |N2| is a 100 element 1D array of random values chosen from a gaussian
    distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 2.0. Generate a
    scatterplot as shown below, using filled circles (markersize 3.0). The |y| colour is blue and the |z| colour is red. Pay attention to the axis labels, tick marks, and
    ranges.

 4.

    Re-plot the data from Question 3 using subplots, as shown below. Be
    sure to replicate the axis limits, and axis labeling. Use boldface
    font to add a title to each subplot (A, B, and C, aligned to the
    left of each subplot as shown below).

    Hint: adjust the |hspace| parameter for subplots so that the subplots don’t overlap:

    | <#cb2-1>plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.6)|

    Do your best to replicate all of the elements of the Figure. Note
    that the data values may look different if your random number
    generator produced different random values. That’s OK.

    Hint: |ax.spines["top"].set_visible(False)| will turn off the top part of the box outlining each plot
