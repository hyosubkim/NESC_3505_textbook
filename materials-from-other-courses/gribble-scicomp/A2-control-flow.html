    Newton’s Method for Square Root

Write a short program to estimate the square root of any number using
Newton’s method
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#Examples>. Write your
program so that the number whose square root is to be taken, and the
number of iterations to be used, are both variables that can be set at
the top of the program. You can choose the initial guess on your own,
use whatever you like. I suggest the number 10.0 as in the Wikipedia
example.

Find the square root of 612 using 5 iterations. Try it again using 10
iterations.

This is the relevant section of the Wikipedia entry and the only bit you
need in order to complete this assignment. The relevant equation is
highlighted in a red box.

The idea is you start with an initial guess (in this case, |10|). The initial guess is then passed through an equation (shown in the
red box) to refine it (in the example, it gets refined to |35.6|). That refined guess then becomes the next guess which is passed
through the same equation again, and further refined.

*Hint*: the first 3 iterations (after the initial guess of |10|) should produce this:

| <#cb1-1>10
 <#cb1-2>35.6
 <#cb1-3>26.395505617977527
 <#cb1-4>24.790635492455475|
