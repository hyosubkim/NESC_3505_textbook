    "In this lab course you will spend a lot of time analyzing data using computer programs that you partially design yourself.

    "A Jupyter notebook \"is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text\" [[www.jupyter.org](http://www.jupyter.org/)]. What you are currently reading is actually a Jupyter notebook! (More on that later.) Rather than have everyone in class set up their home computer (which can be difficult across many different home computer types) we will instead use a web-based (or \"cloud-based\") solution. The Jupyter notebooks that we will be using are hosted online at [ubc.syzygy.ca](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) so you don't need to install any software on your own computer. Whenever you have access to the internet, you'll have access to your programming environment.\n",

    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "You are currently viewing a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are composed of *cells*. Cells can be of three types: code, Markdown, or raw. This cell you're reading is Markdown, a simple language for formatting rich text. The cell below is a code cell, where you can write and run Python commands. Raw cells are \"raw\" text — they aren't fancy-formatted Markdown, and they aren't run-able as code. They also aren't terribly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells have two modes: **edit** and **command**. Edit mode is indicated by a green border around the cell, while command mode has a blue border. In edit mode, you can type into the cell and edit it. In command mode, you can run the cell, or manipulate it in certain ways (e.g., deleting a whole cell, or moving it).\n",
    "\n",
    "This text you are currently reading is a Markdown cell. If you are viewing it in Syzygy, and click once on this text, the cell should become active in command mode, so you should see a blue border around it. If you double-click on this (or any other Markdown) cell, the outline will turn green, the text will change to a *fixed-width* font and you'll see the Markdown formatting tags (like `#` for headings). Try it! Then hit Shift & Enter to execute the cell (which applies and renders the Markdown formatting).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary:\n",
    "- Single-clicking a cell will select it in Command mode\n",
    "- Double-clicking a cell will put it in Edit mode\n",
    "- Pressing the Shift & Enter keys on your keyboard simultaneously will execute a cell. Execution will format a Markdown cell, or run the code in a code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a code cell with some very simple Python code. You haven't started learning Python yet, but as you can see, at its simplest Python can act like a calculator. Try executing the cell and see what happens."

Firstly, The text to the left of the cell changed from `In: []:` to `In [1]:` (or some number). \"In\" stands for \"input\", and the number indicates that the cell was run, and the numbers increase sequentially as you run cells. In general, it's a good idea to run Jupyter notebook cells sequentially, from top to bottom. But sometimes, when you're writing and debugging your code, you'll run them many times before you get it right, and sometimes you'll run a few cells and then go back and run them again. So the numbers are useful in keeping track of what you've done, in what order. If a process takes a while to run, then the cell will show `In: [*]:` while the cell is running. \n",

The traditional notebook interface is prefered here primarily because it simple and faciliates reading along.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computational notebook typically is made up of a set of elements called \"cells\" that group little bits of information together.  A notebook document (usually ending with the .ipynb extension on the file name) is a list of cells arranged from the top of the document to the bottom.  Cells can contain several types of information including code, text, images and so forth.  You develop your project by creating new cells, entering information, reordering cells, and saving the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key element which makes a notebook \"computational\" is that it can be linked to a computing engine known as a \"kernel\" which can run on the same computer or another computer using the Internet.  The kernel is separate from the notebook and can for instance be stopped and started independently from the program displaying the notebook itself. The magic happens when a cell is \"executed\", which refers simply to making the code in the cell \"go\".  When this happens the code from the cell that was executed is sent to the computational kernel and this kernel will run the sequence of commands contained within the cell. Any results such as figures or printouts from the results of that code running will be sent to the notebook from the kernel and will be inserted beneath the cell which was just executed. A diagram of the basic conceptual idea is shown in {numref}`Figure {number} <jupyterflow>`."

    "One somewhat confusing aspect of Jupyter for beginners is that the notebook is simply a way to organize information and the order of information in a notebook has nothing to do with the order in which code has been executed on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, each time you execute a cell, the commands from that cell are sent to the kernel, run, and then returned.  Usually it make sense to organize your code so that multiple cells are arranged in order from the top of the document to the bottom.  You would then execute the first cell, then the second cell, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, **and this is really important**, you don't have to execute the cells in order.  You can execute the third cell before the second or first cell if you want.  This just means that the code in the third cell would be sent to the kernel first and then the other cells would be sent.  This means that the order of the cells in the notebook document are really just for presentation, and it is up to you to \"run/execute\" the cells in whatever order you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mostly helpful because when you are doing an analysis you might want to go back up to the top and change something and then continue where you left off.  To do that you could scroll back to a earlier cell, change it, then execute it and then go back down to the beginning of the script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, things can get confusing. If you delete a cell it doesn't mean the code was \"undone\". The kernel doesn't know anything about any edits you make to the notebook interface.  All it does is receive code when you send it via the \"execute cell\" command and then it waits. This can mean that the \"state\" or current status of the kernel can at times be different from what your cells or notebook look like.  One easy option to deal with this is that if things get too far out of whack you can simply restart the kernel. This will erase its current state and set it back to a fresh start. However, then you need to re-execute all of the cells in your notebook to get back to where you were.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best analogy is like telling your friend how to cook a meal for you over the phone. You have the instructions in front of you (your notebook) and you tell your friend (the kernel) what to do. If you read the instructions out of order, your friend can't tell the difference. They just know each step you told them to do and follow it. It is up to you to direct the instructions so they arrive to your friend (the kernel) in the right order. And of course if things get confused you can just tell your friend to start over from stratch and begin again.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first this can be confusing but eventually you get the hang of it. It is one source of bugs/errors in programming in Jupyter notebooks, though, so you want to be mindful of that.

    "Although for most of your work you will receive assignments with pre-made files to work in, for projects, for practice, or just for fun, you can create new files — including Jupyter notebooks but a variety of others as well. The `File > New` menu item will give you the options for different types of files you can create. The `File`menu also provides options for downloading your notebook files, including converting them from Jupyter notebooks to PDFs or other formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have multiple files open at once, and they appear as tabs at the top of the Syzygy window. In general, the tabs/files you have open will stay there even when you close your browser window/tab or log out, so the next time you connect to Syzygy you'll see those tabs still there. **HOWEVER** (and this is important), even if you leave your browser with the Syzygy window/tab open on your computer, Syzygy will \"terminate\" your running notebook after about 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple files open, normally they'll just appear as tabs across the top. However, over in the top right section of the window, you'll find these buttons:\n",

    "### Running Kernels, and Items in Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem contradictory: how is it that the file is still open, but the notebook is terminated? The answer lies in the fact that when you open a notebook file, you are _also_ starting a new Python **kernel** — a live, running instance of Python that will interpret your Python commands and produce output. Remember: The notebook and kernel states are not the same! Each notebook you open will start a new Python kernel. As long as the kernel is running, the things you do in Python will be stored in memory (RAM). This will make more sense as you start to use Python, but when you're running Python, you generally don't just run commands and get output. You also read data files into memory, and store the results of one command in memory for use in the next command. For example, a bit earlier in this notebook you were instructed to run a cell with the code:\n",
    "`x = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "This *assigned* a value of `1` to a *variable* named `x`. This is now stored in RAM inside this notebook's kernel, so now in the cell below if you type\n",

The next time you open or start to use the notebook, if you tried to run that `print(x)` command without running the cells above it, you would get an error, because `x` is no longer in memory. You would need to start at the top of the file and run all the commands again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this isn't a big deal. Python is very efficient, and for the most part we are working with reasonably small data sets so your code should not take long to run or re-run. It is important to understand this, though, because you will get confusing errors if you come back to your work after several hours, and try to just pick up where you left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're wondering why kernels are automatically terminated, it's because Syzygy runs on cloud servers. Every active kernel is consuming resources (computer hardware and energy) at a data centre somewhere. Terminating \"idle\" kernels saves Syzygy's operator money, as well as reducing the energy demands of the data centre.\n",

This menu has several options, including restarting a kernel manually (which will clear everything out of memory, somthing you may want to do sometimes as you're working in order to get a fresh start rather than trying to un-do errors you made), running all the cells in the notebook (an easy way to get back to where you left off, when your kernel terminated), and clearing all of the output in the notebook.\n",

    "[**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a \"plain text formatting syntax\" and a tool for converting such plain text to a formatted version, such as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) for display in a web page. There is a fundamental difference between plain text (.txt files) versus rich text (such as in Markdown, and also Microsoft Word or Google Docs). Rich text files display the text that you enter, and the formatting you choose (e.g., boldface), and hide the information telling your computer to make that text boldface \"behind the scenes\" in a complex file. In contrast, when you open a plain text file, what you see is literally the contents of that file, with nothing hiding in the background (except for a couple of hidden features, like markers for line breaks and tabs).\n",
    "\n",
    "So a plain text file can never contain formatting like boldface or italic. Markdown allows you to create a text file with special codes that you type to \"mark\" certain text for formatting, and then run a program on that text file to produce a formatted output. For example, text surrounded by `*one asterisk*` shows up in *italics*; text surrounded by `**two asterisks**` shows up as **boldface**.\n",

    "- this is another list item\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate a numbered list by starting each line with a number, then a period, then a space. A nice feature is that if you start *every* item in your list with `1. `, Markdown will auto-number your items:\n",
    "1. This is item 1\n",
    "1. This is item 2, even though the Markdown starts with `1. `\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different levels of headings\n",
    "Different levels of headings can be indicated with hash marks; the more hash marks, the more deeply embedded a header is. So, the following:\n",
    "- `# Heading 1` = first-level heading (like the title at the very top of this page)\n",
    "- `## Heading 2` = second-level heading (like the title of the section titled 'Markdown')\n",
    "- `### Heading 3` = third-level heading (heading of this section)\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "While originally Markdown was designed to simplify creating web pages in HTML (the coding language for web pages), there are now a huge number of output formats available (e.g., PDF, Microsoft Word, ePub) in different applications, and many Markdown apps that allow you write and edit Markdown files while viewing a preview of the formatted output in another window alongside your Markdown text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML — and by extension, Markdown — embodies a design philosophy of separating the content of a document from its formatting. That is, when writing the content, you focus on writing, not how it's going to look, and then later, you apply formatting to make it look a certain way. This means that the same document can be formatted in virtually any possible way, with different fonts, sizes, etc.. It also provides consistency (e.g., you don't have to remember to manually make every first-level heading a specific larger font size, and bold) and makes it very easy to produce professional-looking output without professional web design skills.\n",
