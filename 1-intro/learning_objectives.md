The learning outcomes for this class can be characterized as a mix of “hard” and “soft” skills; both are equally valuable to your intellectual and personal development. At the end of this class, you should be able to:

## Hard Skills
- Extract meaning from data, but also articulate the limitations of the conclusions you can draw from it
- Write functional and efficient code in Python to perform basic data science tasks
- Read and write data files in common formats such as CSV and Excel
- Organize and manipulate data structures
- Work with continuous, discrete, and factorial data
- Visualize data in a variety of graphical formats
- Perform exploratory data analysis using graphical and basic statistical operations
- Perform basic signal processing on data, such as filtering in temporal and spatial dimensions
- Build and run data processing pipelines on various types of neuroscientific data, including single unit recordings, time series, and 2D/3D/4D images
- Understand basic concepts and common tools used in machine learning
- Extend your Python skills using online resources

## Soft Skills
- Demonstrate a professional work ethic
- Work collaboratively, effectively, and productively in a distributed team
- Manage projects: manage time and human resources effectively to achieve specific objectives on a stated timeline
- Peer-review the work of other team members
- Teach others skills and solutions you discover, and communicate your approach to discovering these
- Articulate your strengths and weaknesses as a data scientist working in a team, and identify ways to improve your abilities
- dDmonstrate skills you have developed using a portfolio of work, to potential supervisors/employers
- Use, and communicate the value of, open and reproducible code and data
