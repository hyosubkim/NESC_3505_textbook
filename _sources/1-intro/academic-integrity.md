# Academic Integrity and Collaboration

In this course, you will be explicitly encouraged to collaborate with your peers. This will occur in various formats, but most prominently in the forms of [pair programming](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/WilliamsUpchurch.pdf) and teaching each other concepts and skills. 

However, at the end of the day, you must take responsibility for your own learning and be able to demonstrate your new programming skills and knowledge. This means that when working on problem sets, you should struggle with finding the solutions on your own first. Seeking help should come only after you are first able to clearly articulate what you've tried, what feedback you received from Python/Jupyter/etc., and what you think might be the problem. This applies to asking for guidance from the instructors as well as your classmates. Without the struggle, there can be no learning. Everyone having to shoulder this responsibility means you all benefit more from your interactions, as we can all communicate in good faith with one another!
