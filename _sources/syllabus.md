# Syllabus 

## Basic Course Information
KIN 482E Advanced Seminar in Neuromechanics ("Data Science for Kinesiology"); 2023 Winter Term I; 3 credit hours 

## Time and Place
Mon and Wed, 9:30 - 11:00 am, UBC Life Building (Room 2214)

## Description
Learn how to write code and use data science tools for processing, analyzing, and interpreting data. 

**Long version:** This course provides hands-on experience with learning to program in Python. Students will learn how to think algorithmically in order to process, visualize, and analyze data related to all types of research questions. Through a combination of tutorials, problem sets, and a final project, students will learn some of the most important tools and techniques in the Python data science ecosystem. This course will be especially useful for undergraduate students interested in getting actively involved in research at UBC. In addition, this course provides a strong background for future advanced undergraduate and graduate work in computational approaches to kinesiology, including modeling. However, even for students who do not plan to do scientific research in the future, this course will still provide a solid foundation in core computing and data science skills that will serve them well whether going into industry, healthcare, or another technical field.

## Learning Materials
We will be using an open-source textbook available for free on the Web:

## Hardware & Software 
Students are required to bring a laptop (or chromebook) to both lectures and tutorials. Students who do not own a laptop or chromebook may be able to [loan a laptop from the UBC library](https://services.library.ubc.ca/computers-technology/technology-borrowing/).

All other required software will be provided by the instructors. Students will learn to perform their analysis using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/). Worksheets and tutorial problem sets will be compelted using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) accessed via UBC's instance of JupyterHub.

## Prerequisites
Completion of two of the following courses: 
- KIN 310 
- KIN 311 "Sensorimotor Control of Human Movement"
- KIN 313 "Neuromuscular Integration of Human Movement"
- KIN 316 "Biomechanical Properties of Tissues"
- KIN 411 "Neuroanatomy of Human Movement"
- KIN 419 "Laboratory Investigations in Neuromechanical Kinesiology"

***No prior programming experience is expected or required.***

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, you will be able to: 

- Write code in a high-level programming language (i.e., Python).
- Process, visualize, and analyze data using some of the most powerful (and popular) tools in data science (e.g., pandas, NumPy, Jupyter).
- Effectively visualize and present the results of your data analyses.
- Apply your computing and data science skills towards working with and understanding neural and kinematic data.
- Approach and solve novel problems in a logical, step-wise (algorithmic) manner.
- Leave the class well-prepared to advance your programming and data analysis skills, whether in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses (e.g., statistics, modeling, machine learning, etc.), academic research, or industry.

**Professor**: [Hyosub Kim](ccmlab.org)  
**Email**: [hyosub.kim@ubc.ca](mailto:hyosub.kim@ubc.ca)  
**Office Hours**: By appointment.   

**Teaching Assistant**: TBD 
**Email**: TBD   
**Office Hours**: TBD 

**Please read the course policy (e.g., late registration, missing quiz/assignment due to sickness) below before contacting.**

## Comunication

- There are no formal office hours. Please speak to the instructor(s) to schedule a meeting. 
- Before emailing your course instructor or TA, please check the syllabus, course materials, your notes, and ask your classmates. Also be advised that we will not answer course content-related questions over email. That is, we will not be explaining concepts, helping with assignments, or teaching over email. We are here to guide and instruct you, and you will be best served by being engaged in class and engaging your teaaching team in person. The best time to ask questions is during class time. That being said, do email the instructor if you have a private matter you need to discuss. 

## Course Format
This course will generally follow a schedule of one lecture, one tutorial/lab per week. One thing that you may find different about the course format is that we will employ a **flipped classroom** approach for > 50% of the time. This means that class time, even during "lecture" days, is not used primarily for conveying information, the way a normal lecture-based class operates. Rather, there will be mini-lectures at the start of class that highlight key concepts, and the remaining time will be used for practicing the news coding skills you will be learning. The lecture days will generally have more lecture content than tutorial days, which are mostly devoted to continued practice of the skill/concept taught during the Monday lecture. Therefore, there is a strong emphasis placed on being prepared for each class session by reading the assigned chapter of the textbook and keeping track of questions that arise, and asking them **during class**. Class time is an opportunity for students to discuss the course material, practice their skills, and ask questions from the teaching team. **Coding is a skill, and like any skill, it requires significant practice within and outside of class.** 

A link to the current schedule can be found here (create link) and will be updated as we go.

## Assessments (combined: 55%) 
- Quiz (in-person): Wed, October 4
- Midterm Exam (in-person): Wed, November 8
- Final Exam (in-person): TBD

These assessments require a thorough understanding of the course material. While they will be "open book", you will still be required to demonstrate your ability to write code and problem solve by answering a series of multiple-choice, short answer (code), and conceptual questions. The final exam will be scheduled for a sometime during December 11 - 22. Do not book any travel plans for this time until the final exam has been scheduled. 

### Labs and Problem Sets (combined: 40%)
Each week, there will be a lab/tutorial notebook that must be completed, and roughly every other week, a more challenging problem set will be assigned. Due dates will be posted on Canvas. To open the assignment, click the link (e.g. lab_01) from Canvas. We will go over in detail the proper steps to submiting your assignments during the first class session. Briefly, to submit your assignment, make sure your work is saved (File -> Save and Checkpoint to be sure) on the JupyterHub server, download the notebook to your personal computer, and then upload it to the appropriate Assignment on Canvas. It is critical that you check your notebook before submitting by clicking "Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Run All" and making sure that it runs properly from top-to-bottom without any errors. This is the first step we will take in grading your assingments and if it does not run error free, no credit will be given for the assignment. 

We will also drop your lowest score on a problem set when calculating your final grade. 

### DataCamp (5%)
In this course, we will leverage the significant resources that [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com), a massive open online course (MOOC) platform for data science education, can provide. The teaching team will add all students registered in this class to the class DataCamp "group", using the email address you provide to us. You will receive an invitation email from DataCamp with a link that will allow you to set a password. Once you have logged in for the first time, you will see a window like the one below, listing your active assignments; click on "DUE BY" to sort them by due date (which also indicates the sequence you should complete the assignments in). On the right, there is a trophy icon to see the leaderboard. This is a DataCamp-specific feature that tracks all students' progress, but it has no bearing on your grade---so keep the competition friendly!

```

Each DataCamp assignment has a due date, which conveys when you need to have covered that material in order to keep up with the work in KIN 482. **Each DataCamp assignment will take you approximately 4 hours.** Each one has an estimated duration that you'll see when you start it, and these seem fairly accurate. DataCamp will remember your progress, so you don't have to complete an assignment all in one sitting. You can work in smaller or larger chunks at your preference, log off, and log back on to resume the course later. Note that with DataCamp you have as many opportunities as you need to provide the correct solution. This part of your grade is essentially making sure you are practicing the skills you need to succeed in the course and write functional code.

## Policies 

### Late Registration
Students who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.

### Late Assignments / Quiz or Exam Absence
Students **must be present** at the invigilation venue (in class, examination centre, etc) to take exams; otherwise, they will be considered to have missed the exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.

Students who will miss a quiz **must provide a self-declaration of academic concession prior to the quiz** (see Canvas homepage for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the quiz will result in a grade of zero.

There will be **no extensions for the labs and assignments**; late assignments will receive a grade of zero. 

### Device/Browser
Students are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended; Safari has had issues with Canvas quizzes in the past.

### Missed Final Exam
Students who miss the final exam must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.

### Academic Concession Policy
Please see [UBC's concession policy](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0) for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework, quizzes, and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.

See our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.

### Academic Integrity
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, integrity, and accountability. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University's policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).

### Plagiarism

Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:

-   the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)
-   the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another
-   the generation of code by automatic code-generation software

**Plagiarism of any form will result in serious penalties, up to and including failure of the course.**

## University Policies
UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.
Details of the policies and how to access support are available on the [UBC Senate website](https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success/).
