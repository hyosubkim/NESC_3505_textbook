# Learning Objectives

Once you've completed this lesson you should be able to:

### Spike trains
- define spike trains
- explain how spike train data is recorded
- describe two ways of storing spike train data: time series and spike times
- generate two type of visualizations of spike train data: raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs)
- interpret raster plots and PSTHs with respect to experimental manipulations
- generate 2D heat maps of PSTHs
- work with data sets comprising thousands of rows
- generate correlation matrices of spike train data from multi-unit recordings

### Python
- create and work with data in lists, NymPy arrays, and pandas DataFrames
- use nested list comprehension
- use subplots to plot multiple levels of data in a single graphic
- generate 2D images from data

### Data Visualization
- make informed decisions about accessible design in scientific visualization, including colour map choice and interpolation methods
