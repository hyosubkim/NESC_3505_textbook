# Acknowledgments

First of all, I owe a great debt of gratitude to [Aaron J. Newman](https://aaronjnewman.com/) of Dalhousie University for sharing his excellent open-source textbook, [Data Science for Psychology and Neuroscience - in Python](https://neuraldatascience.io/intro.html). What you see now is an edited/remixed/adapted version of the original book, one that I hope will best suit undergraduate Kinesiology students at The University of British Columbia. Much of the original work has largely been kept intact, although a couple of notable changes include substituting the chapters on EEG and MRI data with one on signal processing, as well as the addition of a section on writing functions. My goal is that this book will evolve and take on a life of its own over iterations of teaching the course and serve as a useful, open resource for those studying and researching human movement.

There are others whose work I have also adopted (and adapted) and to whom I am very grateful:
- [Meghan Allen](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/meghan-allen) of UBC for the section on writing functions, evaluating expressions, and some early tutorial materials
- [Paul Gribble](https://gribblelab.org/) of Western University for his [chapter on signal processing](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2014/09_Signals_sampling_filtering.html)
- [Todd Gureckis](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/todd-gureckis.html) and [Brendan Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) for sharing materials from their [NYU course on Cognition and Perception](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/courses/labincp/intro.html)
- [Jessica Hamrick](http://www.jesshamrick.com/) for the Jupyter-based teaching materials
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) for all of their great tutorials
