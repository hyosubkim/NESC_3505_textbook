# Welcome!

```{note}
This is a draft version of the book I am working on. Currently, it is *primarily* a collection of open-source educational content that I've copied, combined, and joined in one location. This is meant to serve as a blueprint for later drafts that will rework some of the primary source material (see [Acknowledgments](section-label)) and add to it as well.

This course provides hands-on experience with learning to program in Python. Students will learn how to think computationally and algorithmically in order to analyze data and solve all sorts of problems, especially those related to movement science. Through exercises, problem sets, and group projects, students will also be exposed to key concepts in the study of sensorimotor control and learning. The data analyzed include biomechanical, reaction time, neurophysiological, and perceptual decision-making data. The course culminates in an intensive final project involving the analysis of an open source data set.

This course is especially useful for undergraduate students interested in getting actively involved in research at UBC. In addition, this course provides a strong background for future graduate work in all aspects of kinesiology. However, even if you do not plan to do scientific research in the future, this course will provide you with a solid foundation in computing that will serve you well should you go into industry, healthcare, or any other technical field.
